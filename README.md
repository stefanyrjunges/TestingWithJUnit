# Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito

🙋‍♀️ This project is part of a learning journey in unit testing and
test-driven development (TDD), particularly for real-world Java applications like
login pages and database interactions.
It consists on a simple login system in Java that connects to a database and
**tests using JUnit 5 and Mockito**.

The login method checks if a user's credentials are valid by querying a database.
To keep tests fast, safe, and reliable, **Mockito was used to mock the database connection**
instead of relying on a real database during testing.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **JUnit 5** (for writing tests)
- **Mockito** (for mocking the database)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
